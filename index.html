<b>How the Web Works</b>
<p>The web is a bunch of computers that communicate with each other. When a person goes to a web page like www.google.com, their computer sends a <em>HTTP Request</em> to a <em>server</em>. The server finds the appropriate HTML document and sends it back
  to the user's computer where a <em>web browser</em> interprets the page and displays it on the user's screen.

<b>HTML</b>
<p>HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language.</em> HTML documents form the majority of the content on the web. HTML documents contain <em>text content</em> which describes "what you see" and <em>markup</em> which describes "how it looks".

<b>Tags and Elements</b>
<p>HTML documents are made of HTML <b>elements</b>. When writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element by using HTML <b>tags</b>.

<b>Why Computers are Stupid</b>
<p>Computers are stupid because they interpret instructions literally. This makes them very unforgiving since a small mistake by a programmer can cause huge problems in a program.
</p>

<b>Inline vs Block Elements</b>
<p>HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>. Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them.

<h2>Ways of Thinking</h2>

<b>5 Ways</b>
<p>Procedural Thinking -It involves big-picture thinking and decision-making about a problem and how different pieces of a program can work together to solve it. </p> 

<p>Abstract Thinking -generality amongst seemingly different things</p> 

<p> Systems Thinking -It involves big-picture thinking and decision-making about a problem and how different pieces of a program can work together to solve it.</p> 

<p> Technological Empathy -basic understanding of how these tools work</p> 

<p> Debugging -systematic process of relentlessly identifying the cause of a computer program that doesn't work.</p>
